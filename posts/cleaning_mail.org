I have tried to stop using gmail webmail in favour of
mbsync+imapnotify+mu+mu4e setup recently.  This way, I have all my
emails in a maildir on my laptop.  When playing with the
configurations, I have noticed that the size of the maildir is quite
large - no surprise, given that I did not delete any emails, only mark them
as read.  

I have decided to try and delete as much crap newsletters
and other useless stuff filling large part of my inbox.  But how to
recall all the mailing lists I was ever part of?  Sorting senders by
number of emails I have received from them could be really useful.
Unfortunately, this cannot be done in gmail AFAIK, but it should be
easily done with all the emails available locally.

First, I have written a python script that outputs a list of unique
sender addresses.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  #!/usr/bin/python
  import mailbox
  from email.utils import parseaddr

  senders = []
  for message in mailbox.Maildir('~/.mail/gmail/[Gmail].All Mail'):
      sender = message.get('from', None)
      if sender:
          senders.append(parseaddr(sender)[1])

  senders = set(senders)

  with open('/tmp/senders.txt', 'w') as fout:
      fout.write('\n'.join(senders))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Second, I had to get the number of emails received from each of
these.  Although this could have been done easily from python, I was
stupid enough to split it into two tasks :D.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ cat senders.txt | while read mail; do num=`mu find --quiet from:$mail | wc -l`; echo "$num - $mail"; done | sort -n > output.txt
#+END_EXAMPLE

I have then manually deleted all messages from the guilty senders via
the gmail webmail (just to make sure I won't mess up).  Wow, such a
bad solution overall :D.  Needless to say - I have reduced the size of
the maildir quite significantly (over 2GB).
