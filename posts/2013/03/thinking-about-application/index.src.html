<html><body><p>So... I want to create Android app. And it should be unique :)<br>It will help people to recycle easier in Prague (mainly in historical center where recycling is really hard) by showing them nearest recycle bins.<br>(It will be probably very hard to get recycle bins positions from Prazske sluzby a.s. so so far I will only incorporate looking for nearest scrap yards, but it should not be hard to change that if the data will be available)<br><br>For next week I want to get some ideas on graphical layout and basic functionality.</p></body></html>
